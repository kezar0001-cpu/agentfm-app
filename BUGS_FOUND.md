**Non-Critical Issues**: 1 (documented)
**Test Results**: 129/129 tests passing ✅

## Critical Issues

### 1. ❌ Reports API uses non-existent ReportRequest model
**File**: `backend/src/routes/reports.js`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - API will crash on any request
**Root Cause**: Code references `prisma.reportRequest` but schema only has `Report` model (tied to inspections)
**Impact**: All report endpoints (POST /, GET /, GET /:id/download) will fail with Prisma errors
**Fix**: Either create ReportRequest model or refactor to use existing Report model correctly



## Issues to Investigate

- [ ] Check all async routes have proper error handling
- [ ] Verify CORS configuration for all environments
- [ ] Check for N+1 query issues
- [ ] Check for unhandled promise rejections in frontend

## Non-Critical Issues

### API Response Format Inconsistency
**Severity**: LOW - Functional but inconsistent
**Description**: API endpoints return different response formats:
- Properties: `{success: true, property: {...}}`
- Jobs: Direct object `{id, title, ...}`
- ServiceRequests: Direct object `{id, title, ...}`
**Impact**: Frontend needs to handle different response formats
**Recommendation**: Standardize all endpoints to use `{success: true, data: {...}}` format
**Status**: Documented (not blocking)

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Reports API uses non-existent ReportRequest model
**File**: `backend/src/routes/reports.js`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - API was crashing on any request
**Root Cause**: Code referenced `prisma.reportRequest` but model didn't exist in schema
**Fix Applied**: 
- Created ReportRequest model in schema.prisma with proper relations
- Added reportRequests relation to User, Property, and Unit models
- Created migration: `20251029104426_add_report_request_model`
- Verified backend server starts successfully
- Verified reports endpoint responds (requires auth)
**Status**: FIXED ✅

### 3. ✅ Auth API uses non-existent PasswordReset model
**File**: `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Password reset functionality was broken
**Root Cause**: Code referenced `prisma.passwordReset` but model didn't exist in schema
**Impact**: All password reset endpoints would fail with Prisma errors
**Fix Applied**:
- Created PasswordReset model with fields: userId, selector, verifier, expiresAt, usedAt
- Added passwordResets relation to User model
- Created migration: `20251029104808_add_password_reset_model`
- Verified backend server starts successfully
**Status**: FIXED ✅

### 2. ✅ Maintenance API uses non-existent models
**File**: `backend/src/routes/maintenance.js`
**Severity**: CRITICAL - API was crashing on any request
**Root Cause**: Code referenced `prisma.maintenanceRequest`, `prisma.requestEvent`, `prisma.requestMessage` but these models don't exist in schema
**Impact**: All maintenance endpoints would fail with Prisma errors
**Analysis**: 
- ServiceRequest model already exists with similar functionality
- Frontend doesn't use maintenance endpoints
- maintenance.js appears to be duplicate/unused code
**Fix Applied**:
- Renamed maintenance.js to maintenance.js.unused
- Disabled maintenance route registration in index.js
- Added comments directing to use /serviceRequests instead
- Verified backend server starts successfully
**Status**: FIXED ✅

### 3. ✅ Auth API uses non-existent PasswordReset model
**File**: `backend/src/routes/auth.js`

**Impact**: All password reset endpoints would fail with Prisma errors
**Fix Applied**:
- Created PasswordReset model with fields: userId, selector, verifier, expiresAt, usedAt
- Added passwordResets relation to User model
- Created migration: `20251029104808_add_password_reset_model`
