# Dashboard Data Display Fix

## Issue

Dashboard page was not showing any data:
- Property, unit, job, and inspection counts showed 0
- Recent activity tab was empty
- Stats cards displayed no information

## Root Cause

**Backend Response Structure:**
```javascript
// GET /api/dashboard/summary
{
  success: true,
  summary: {
    properties: { total: 5, active: 4, inactive: 1 },
    units: { total: 20, occupied: 15, available: 5 },
    jobs: { total: 10, open: 3, inProgress: 5, completed: 2 },
    inspections: { total: 8, scheduled: 3, completed: 5 },
    alerts: [...]
  }
}

// GET /api/dashboard/activity
{
  success: true,
  items: [
    { type: 'job', title: '...', ... },
    { type: 'inspection', title: '...', ... }
  ]
}
```

**Frontend Expected Structure:**
```javascript
// Frontend was expecting response.data to be the summary directly
response.data = {
  properties: { total: 5, ... },
  units: { total: 20, ... },
  ...
}
```

**The Problem:**
- Frontend: `return response.data` → Returns `{ success: true, summary: {...} }`
- Frontend: `summary?.properties?.total` → Tries to access `{ success: true, summary: {...} }?.properties?.total`
- Result: `undefined` because `properties` doesn't exist at the top level

## Solution

Extract the nested data from the backend response:

### Summary Data
```javascript
// Before
const response = await apiClient.get('/dashboard/summary');
return response.data; // { success: true, summary: {...} }

// After
const response = await apiClient.get('/dashboard/summary');
return response.data?.summary || response.data; // Extract nested summary
```

### Activity Data
```javascript
// Before
const response = await apiClient.get('/dashboard/activity?limit=10');
return response.data; // { success: true, items: [...] }

// After
const response = await apiClient.get('/dashboard/activity?limit=10');
return response.data?.items || response.data; // Extract nested items array
```

## Changes

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`

1. **Summary Query:**
   - Extract `response.data.summary` instead of using `response.data` directly
   - Fallback to `response.data` for backward compatibility

2. **Activity Query:**
   - Extract `response.data.items` instead of using `response.data` directly
   - Fallback to `response.data` for backward compatibility

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ All stat cards showed 0
- ❌ No properties, units, jobs, or inspections displayed
- ❌ Recent activity tab was empty
- ❌ Dashboard appeared broken/non-functional

### After Fix
- ✅ Stat cards show correct counts
- ✅ Properties, units, jobs, and inspections display properly
- ✅ Recent activity tab shows updates
- ✅ Dashboard fully functional with real data

## Testing

1. **Verify Summary Data:**
   - Properties card shows correct total, active, inactive counts
   - Units card shows correct total, occupied, available counts
   - Jobs card shows correct total, open, in progress, overdue counts
   - Inspections card shows correct total, scheduled, upcoming counts

2. **Verify Activity Feed:**
   - Recent activity tab shows recent jobs, inspections, service requests
   - Activity items display correct titles, descriptions, and statuses
   - Activity items are sorted by date (most recent first)

3. **Verify Alerts:**
   - Subscription alerts display correctly
   - Overdue jobs alert shows when applicable
   - Upcoming inspections alert shows when applicable

## Backend Compatibility

The fix maintains backward compatibility:
- If backend returns `{ summary: {...} }`, it extracts `summary`
- If backend returns the data directly, it uses that
- Uses optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent errors

## Notes

This is a frontend-only fix. The backend API structure is correct and follows best practices by wrapping responses in a success envelope. The frontend just needed to extract the nested data properly.
