## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Access Control

**Technician**:
```javascript
// Backend: Jobs route
if (req.user.role === 'TECHNICIAN') {
  where.assignedToId = req.user.id; // Only assigned jobs
}

// Frontend: Redirect to technician dashboard
if (user.role === 'TECHNICIAN') {
  navigate('/technician/dashboard');
}
```

**Owner**:
```javascript
// Backend: Properties route
if (req.user.role === 'OWNER') {
  where.owners = {
    some: { ownerId: req.user.id }
  };
}

// Frontend: No create/edit/delete buttons
{user.role !== 'OWNER' && <Button>Create</Button>}
```

**Tenant**:
```javascript
// Backend: Service requests route
const request = await prisma.serviceRequest.create({
  data: {
    ...formData,
    requestedById: req.user.id, // Auto-set requester
  }
});

// Frontend: Limited to service requests
// No access to properties or jobs routes
```
