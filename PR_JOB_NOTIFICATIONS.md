# Pull Request: Job Assignment & Completion Notifications

## 🎯 Overview

Activates the existing notification service to send real-time alerts when jobs are assigned to technicians and when jobs are completed. This critical feature was implemented but never integrated, blocking efficient workflow coordination.

## 🐛 Problem

**Critical Missing Integration**: Notification service existed with complete implementation but was never called.

**Impact**:
- ❌ Technicians didn't know when jobs were assigned to them
- ❌ Property managers didn't know when jobs were completed
- ❌ Users had to manually check the system for updates
- ❌ Delayed response times and missed SLAs
- ❌ Poor user experience and reduced system value

**User Journey Blocked**:
1. Property manager creates job and assigns to technician
2. **BLOCKED**: Technician never receives notification
3. Technician doesn't check system regularly
4. Job sits unnoticed for hours/days
5. Property manager frustrated by lack of progress

## ✅ Solution

Integrated existing notification service into job creation and update workflows.

### Notification Triggers

#### 1. Job Assignment (Create)
**When**: Job created with `assignedToId`
**Recipient**: Assigned technician
**Notification**: "New Job Assigned: [Job Title]"

```javascript
// After job creation
if (job.assignedToId && job.assignedTo) {
  await notifyJobAssigned(job, job.assignedTo, job.property);
}
```

#### 2. Job Reassignment (Update)
**When**: `assignedToId` changes from one user to another
**Recipients**: Previous technician + New technician
**Notifications**: 
- Previous: "Job Reassigned: You have been unassigned from [Job Title]"
- New: "New Job Assigned: [Job Title]"

```javascript
if (updates.assignedToId !== existingJob.assignedToId) {
  if (existingJob.assignedToId) {
    await notifyJobReassigned(job, previousTechnician, newTechnician, property);
  } else {
    await notifyJobAssigned(job, newTechnician, property);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Job Completion
**When**: Status changes to `COMPLETED`
**Recipient**: Property manager
**Notification**: "[Technician Name] completed: [Job Title]"

```javascript
if (updates.status === 'COMPLETED' && existingJob.status !== 'COMPLETED') {
  await notifyJobCompleted(job, technician, property, manager);
}
```

#### 4. Job Started
**When**: Status changes to `IN_PROGRESS`
**Recipient**: Property manager
**Notification**: "Work has started on: [Job Title]"

```javascript
if (updates.status === 'IN_PROGRESS' && existingJob.status !== 'IN_PROGRESS') {
  await notifyJobStarted(job, property, manager);
}
```

### New Notification Functions

**Added to `notificationService.js`:**

```javascript
// Notify manager when job starts
export async function notifyJobStarted(job, property, manager)

// Notify both technicians when job is reassigned
export async function notifyJobReassigned(job, previousTechnician, newTechnician, property)
```

**Existing Functions (Now Used):**
- ✅ `notifyJobAssigned(job, technician, property)`
- ✅ `notifyJobCompleted(job, technician, property, manager)`

### Email Fix

**Problem**: `notificationService.js` imported `sendEmail` but it didn't exist
**Solution**: Added generic `sendEmail()` function to `email.js`

```javascript
export async function sendEmail(to, subject, html) {
  const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
    from: emailFrom,
    to: to,
    subject: subject,
    html: html,
  });
  // Error handling...
}
```

## 📸 User Experience

### Before
```
Property Manager creates job → Assigns to John
  ↓
John: [No notification]
  ↓
John checks system hours later
  ↓
Job delayed, manager frustrated
```

### After
```
Property Manager creates job → Assigns to John
  ↓
John: 🔔 "New Job Assigned: Fix HVAC at Building A"
  ↓
John clicks notification → Views job details
  ↓
John starts work immediately
  ↓
Manager: 🔔 "Work has started on: Fix HVAC"
  ↓
John completes job
  ↓
Manager: 🔔 "John Doe completed: Fix HVAC"
```
