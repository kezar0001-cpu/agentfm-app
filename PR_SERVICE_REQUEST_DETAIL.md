# Pull Request: Service Request Detail View

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements a **critical missing feature** that unblocks the core maintenance workflow. Service requests are the primary entry point for maintenance work, but users could not view full request details - only truncated 100-character previews.

**Impact**: Enables informed decision-making for property managers reviewing tenant service requests.

---

## 📋 Summary

### Problem Statement

**Critical Workflow Blocker:**
- ✅ Backend: GET / (list), POST /, PATCH /:id, POST /:id/convert-to-job
- ❌ Backend: **Missing GET /:id** endpoint
- ❌ Frontend: No detail modal/page - cards show truncated info only
- ⚠️ **UX Issue**: Cards have hover effects suggesting clickability but nothing happens

**User Impact:**
- **Truncated descriptions**: Users see "...more" but cannot click to view full text
- **No photo viewing**: Photos array exists in data model but no way to view them
- **No review history**: Cannot see reviewNotes or reviewedAt timestamp
- **Uninformed decisions**: Managers must approve/reject from truncated 100-char preview
- **Data loss**: Information uploaded by tenants is never viewable

**Blocked Workflow:**
1. Tenant submits service request with photos and detailed description
2. Manager sees request in list with truncated description (100 chars)
3. Manager wants to review full details before approving
4. ❌ **BLOCKED**: No way to view full request details
5. ❌ **BLOCKED**: Cannot see attached photos to assess severity
6. Manager makes uninformed decision or manually contacts tenant

### Solution

Implemented comprehensive **Service Request Detail Modal** with full request information:

1. **Backend**: Added GET /:id endpoint to fetch individual request details
2. **Frontend**: Created ServiceRequestDetailModal component
3. **Integration**: Added onClick handlers to cards in ServiceRequestsPage

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Backend Endpoint: GET /api/service-requests/:id

**Location**: `backend/src/routes/serviceRequests.js`

**Features:**
- Fetch individual service request with full details
- Include property, unit, requester, and converted jobs
- Access control: Property managers, owners, and request author only
- Error handling: 404 for non-existent, 403 for unauthorized
- Optimized queries with selective includes

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "request": {
    "id": "sr_123",
    "title": "Leaky Faucet in Kitchen",
    "description": "Full description...",
    "category": "PLUMBING",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "status": "UNDER_REVIEW",
    "photos": ["url1", "url2"],
    "reviewNotes": "Approved - urgent repair needed",
    "reviewedAt": "2024-10-28T15:15:00Z",
    "property": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "address": "..." },
    "unit": { "id": "...", "unitNumber": "101" },
    "requestedBy": { "id": "...", "firstName": "...", "email": "..." },
    "jobs": [{ "id": "...", "title": "...", "status": "..." }]
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend Modal: ServiceRequestDetailModal

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/ServiceRequestDetailModal.jsx` (400+ lines)

**Features:**
- Display full request details (no truncation)
- Photo gallery with proper layout
- Property and unit information
- Requester details with email
- Review history when available
- Converted jobs list
- Action buttons: Approve, Reject, Convert to Job
- Review notes input with validation
- Loading and error states
- Responsive design

**Component Structure:**
```jsx
<Dialog>
  <DialogTitle>Service Request Details</DialogTitle>
  <DialogContent>
    {/* Title and Status Chips */}
    {/* Full Description */}
    {/* Photo Gallery */}
    {/* Property/Unit/Requester Details */}
    {/* Review History */}
    {/* Converted Jobs */}
    {/* Review Input (when approving/rejecting) */}
  </DialogContent>
  <DialogActions>
    {/* Approve/Reject/Convert buttons based on status */}
  </DialogActions>
</Dialog>
```

### 3. Integration: ServiceRequestsPage

**Location**: `frontend/src/pages/ServiceRequestsPage.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `selectedRequest` state
- Added `onClick={() => setSelectedRequest(request.id)}` to cards
- Added `cursor: 'pointer'` to card styles (already had hover effect)
- Integrated ServiceRequestDetailModal at end of component

## 📊 Technical Details

### Architecture

**Data Flow:**
```
User clicks card → setSelectedRequest(id) → Modal opens
                                          ↓
                                    useQuery fetches data
                                          ↓
                                    Display full details
                                          ↓
User clicks action → useMutation → API call → Success
                                          ↓
                              Invalidate queries → Refetch
                                          ↓
                                    Close modal
```

**State Management:**
- React Query for server state
- Local state for modal open/close
- Local state for review input
- Query invalidation for cache updates

**API Integration:**
```javascript
// Query
useQuery(['service-request', requestId], () => 
  apiClient.get(`/service-requests/${requestId}`)
)

// Mutations
useMutation(({ status, reviewNotes }) => 
  apiClient.patch(`/service-requests/${requestId}`, { status, reviewNotes })
)

useMutation(() => 
  apiClient.post(`/service-requests/${requestId}/convert-to-job`)
)
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Modal only fetches data when opened
2. **Query Caching**: React Query caches for 5 minutes
3. **Selective Includes**: Only fetch necessary relations
4. **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading for photos
5. **Bundle Size**: ~5KB additional (modal component)

### Database Impact

**No Changes Required:**
- All fields already exist in ServiceRequest model
- No migrations needed
- Existing indexes sufficient

- API response time > 1 second
- Modal crash rate > 1%

**Logging:**
```javascript
// Track key user actions
analytics.track('service_request_detail_viewed', { requestId, status });
analytics.track('service_request_photos_viewed', { requestId, photoCount });
analytics.track('service_request_approved', { requestId, hasPhotos });
analytics.track('service_request_rejected', { requestId, reason });
```

### Phase 4: User Communication

**In-App Tooltip:**
```
💡 New Feature: Click any service request to view full details!
