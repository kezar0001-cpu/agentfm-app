## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ PropertyDetailPage - Owner Tab and Recent Activity Tab

**Issues**:
- Owner tab was not showing property owners
- Recent Activity tab showed "coming soon" message

**Fixes**:

#### Backend (`backend/src/routes/properties.js`):
- Added `owners` to property detail query with nested owner information
- Created new endpoint `GET /api/properties/:id/activity` to fetch recent activity
- Activity includes jobs, inspections, service requests, and unit updates
- Sorted by most recent first with configurable limit

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/PropertyDetailPage.jsx`):
- Added `activityQuery` to fetch property activity
- Updated Activity tab to display activity list with status chips and priority badges
- Added `getPriorityColor` helper function
- Enhanced `getStatusColor` to include job, inspection, and service request statuses
- Activity shows type, title, description, status, priority, and timestamp

**Result**: Both Owner and Activity tabs now display data correctly

---

### 2. ‚úÖ InspectionsPage - Detail Page Not Showing

**Issue**:
- Clicking on an inspection went directly to an error page
- No route configured for inspection detail page

**Fix**:

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/App.jsx`):
- Added lazy import for `InspectionDetailPage`
- Added route `/inspections/:id` with proper AuthGate and Layout wrappers

**Result**: Inspection detail page now loads correctly when clicking on an inspection

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Units Workflow - Unable to Click Unit Details

**Issue**:
- Unit cards were not clickable
- No way to view or edit unit details from property page

**Fix**:

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/PropertyDetailPage.jsx`):
- Made unit cards clickable with hover effects
- Added `onClick` handler to open unit edit dialog
- Updated `handleEditUnit` to accept unit parameter
- Added cursor pointer and hover transform effects

**Result**: Users can now click on unit cards to view/edit details

---

### 4. ‚úÖ JobsPage - Add Job Functionality Throwing Error

**Issue**:
- Creating a new job immediately showed "something went wrong, reload page"
- Data extraction issues from API responses

**Fix**:

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/JobForm.jsx`):
- Fixed properties data extraction (backend returns array directly)
- Fixed units data extraction (backend returns array directly)
- Fixed technicians data extraction (backend returns `{ success: true, users: [...] }`)
- Added default empty arrays to prevent undefined errors
- Improved error handling

**Result**: Job creation form now loads correctly with all dropdowns populated
