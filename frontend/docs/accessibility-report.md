# Accessibility Verification - Properties Page

## Summary
- Added ARIA labelling for the search input, filter chips, and property card buttons to improve screen reader support.
- Implemented keyboard enhancements so the Escape key clears the search input and focus-visible outlines are present on chips and buttons.

## Testing
- Ran axe DevTools on the Properties page while the Vite dev server was running. No new violations introduced by the changes.
- Keyboard testing: used `Tab` to move through the search field, chips, and property card buttons; verified focus outlines are visible. Pressed `Enter` to activate chips and buttons and `Escape` to clear the search field.

## Outstanding Issues
- Property image carousel dot controls are not focusable and cannot be operated with the keyboard. Recommend refactoring them into real buttons with visible focus styles.
- Carousel auto-play cannot be paused via keyboard-only interaction; consider adding controls or disabling auto-advance for accessibility compliance.
